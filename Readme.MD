# SML Injected

## Credits
- [SML](https://github.com/lukas0x1/sml-pc) - The original project
- [UniversalHookX](https://github.com/bruhmoment21/UniversalHookX) - The graphical hook that renders VULKAN ImGui

# Dependancies
- [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [MinHook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook)
- [libmem](https://github.com/rdbo/libmem)

# How to build
- Clone the repository
- Open the project in Visual Studio and create a x64 Release with toolset msvc_x64
- Build the project

# How to use
- Download injection.zip from the releases and extract it
- Double-click the injector.exe (TSM is bundled)

If mods are causing issues add the mods resources you get from downloading the mod into **MODS FOLDER OF SKY** (Folder doesn't exist? Create one by right-clicking and pressing folder.)
You can also pin to the taskbar for the injector as it launches sky (added icon for this exact reason)

# Make your own mods
- Download `mod-demo` folder and open it in Visual Studio
- Do whatever and build the same way as the main project

# TODO
- [*] Make my own injector (needs a UI)
- [*] Fix compatibility in general (Testing)
